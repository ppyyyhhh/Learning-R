?c  # Anytime you have questions about a particular function, you can access R's built-in help files via the `?` command. For example, if you want more information on the c() function,

z   #Type z to view its contents. Notice that there are no commas separating the values in the output.

c(z, 555, z)    #You can combine vectors to make a new vector. Create a new vector that contains z, 555, then z again in that order. Don't assign this vector to a new variable, so that we can just see the result immediately.

z * 2 + 100     #Numeric vectors can be used in arithmetic expressions. Type the following to see what happens: z * 2 + 100.
# First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added 100 to each element to get the result you see above.

my_sqrt <- sqrt(z-1) #Take the square root of z - 1 and assign it to a new variable called my_sqrt.
#  a vector of length 3

print(my_sqrt)

my_sqrt     #Just type my_sqrt and press Enter to view its value.
